# Project Description 

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Explore if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. These results will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.  

## Key Questions

1. Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
2. Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
3. Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
4. How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?
